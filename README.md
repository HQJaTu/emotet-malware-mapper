# Emotet (banking trojan malware) mapper
This mapper utility will ingest Emotet banking trojan network information about
pwned sites containing Command & Control and malware distribution endpoints.

More information about Emotet malware is available @ [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet/)
and @ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotet)

## Mapper Usage
Produce the output-JSON from malware researcher's information:
```bash
./mapper.py info.txt map_data.json
```

### (optional) Santizie victim's host information from map-data
```bash
./map_data_sanitizer.py map_data.json map_data-sanitized.json
```


## Heatmap
Emotet banking trojan exists in three known separate botnets, or Epochs.

All three of them contain malware distribution points to contain the links
for malicious documents and/or binaries for innocent people to download into
their computers.

When a computer gets infected, it will connect to one of its C&C (or C2)
endspoints to receive updates and/or commands. The commands include all kinds
of malicious activities, looking for more vulnerable botnet hosts and doing
the actual capture of victims' on-line banking to relieve them from their
hard-earned money.
